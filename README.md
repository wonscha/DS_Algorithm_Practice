# DS_Algorithm_Practice
This repository to archive data strucures and algorithm solutions that I have written.
This repository is for personal archiving purpose. 

Questions are mostly from LeetCode or Udemy courses. 

## Structure of repository
Every problem is contained in its dedicated folder. 
In most cases, each problem folder has a main function file(.js) with direction and solution and a test file(.test.js)

## Test
Test Driven Developement(TDD) is applied in solving the problem and Jest is being used as a testing tool.
If you want to test, please first install npm, and runt test with commands as follows. 
Then Jest will go through all tests wired up.

```
npm install
npm run test
```
