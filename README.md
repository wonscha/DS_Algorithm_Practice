# DS_Algorithm_Practice
This repository is created to archive data strucures and algorithm solutions that Wonsuk has come up with.
So, this repository is for personal archiving purpose. 

Questions are mostly from LeetCode or Udemy courses. 

## Structure of repository
Every problem is contained in its dedicated folder. 
In most cases, each problem folder has a main function file(.js) with direction and solution and a test file(.test.js)

## Test
Test Driven Developement(TDD) is applied in solving the problem. 
As a testing tool, Jest is being used. 
For the test, please first install npm, and runt test as follows. 
Then Jest will go through all tests wired up.

```
npm install
npm run test
```
