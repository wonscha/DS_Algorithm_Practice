# DS_Algorithm_Practice
This repository to archive data strucures and algorithm solutions that I have written.
This repository is for personal archiving purpose. 

Questions are mostly from LeetCode or Udemy courses. 

## Structure of repository
Every problem folder contains a question and solution file(.js) and a Jest test file(.test.js).  

## Test
Test Driven Developement(TDD) is applied in solving the problem and Jest is being used as a testing tool.
If you want to run test, please first install dependencies, and run test with commands as follows. 
Then Jest will go through all tests wired up.

```
npm install
npm run test
```
